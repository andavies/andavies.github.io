title: About Me

I like to refer to myself simply as a programmer, but my current range of skills labels me more specifically as a web developer.

I live in Wirral in the UK (or "on the Wirral" as the locals tend to say). I make websites for small and medium-sized businesses, both locally, nationally and internationally. I also work as a freelance developer for hire on larger projects, either locally in the North West of England or remotely for companies anywhere in the world.

This site is a place for me to show my work and let people know what I can do. I also like to write on a range of subjects: sometimes technical posts that help me to better understand a subject myself (I find writing about a subject helps me to clarify my own understanding), sometimes information that helps my customers better understand what I do, and occasionally posts of more general interest.

If you like my work and are interested in hiring me, see my [contact page]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html).
