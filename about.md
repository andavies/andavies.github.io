I live in Wirral in the UK (or "on the Wirral" as the locals tend to say). This site is a place for me to show my work and let people know what I can do. I also like to write on a range of subjects: sometimes technical posts that help me to better understand a subject myself, sometimes information that helps my customers better understand what I do, and occasionally posts of more general interest.

### If you're a small business owner..

I can make you a fast, modern, responsive website for your business at a competitive price. [Contact me]({{ site.url }}/contact.html) and we can discuss your project with no obligation.

### If you're looking for a freelance programmer for your next project..

Take a look at my [work]({{ site.url }}/projects.html), my [Github](https://github.com/andavies) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/story/5794667) profiles, and if you like what you see [contact me]({{ site.url }}/contact.html).

### If you're looking to hire a developer for your company..

I'm interested in fixed-term contract jobs in the Wirral area, or a remote position anywhere in the world.
