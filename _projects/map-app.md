This project is an example of what [hipsters](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03046/hipster-tash_3046941b.jpg) might call a 'mashup'. I can't bring myself to be that hip, so let's just say that this is an application that intergrates two different APIs, namely the Google Maps API and data on police stop-searches that is available from the police.uk API. In plain English, it's an interactive map that shows the location of recent stop-searches made by the police.

You can try it yourself [here](https://andavies.github.io/map-app/) and view the source code [here](https://github.com/andavies/map-app).
