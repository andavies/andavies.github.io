[Wordwall](https://wordwall.co.uk) is a web application made by Visual Education Ltd that allows teachers to create interactive resources for use in the classroom.

I was hired by Visual Education as a Software Developer in 2016. Alongside their other developers, I worked on a new feature for the site that allowed users to create custom PDF worksheets that compliment the interactive resources. I worked on the server-side, programming in C# on the .NET framework.
