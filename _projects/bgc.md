Broadcast Graphics and Control provide TV companies with control systems for live or near-live on-air graphics. You've probably seen some of their work on the half-time football ads that display live betting odds. 

They have a website already that's a few years old now, and they hired me to make a new site with a modern look and feel. 

They had already purchased a basic Wordpress theme, and they just needed someone to style it up how they wanted it at a reasonable price. You can see the website with my custom CSS [here](http://staging.andy-davies.me/BGC/).
