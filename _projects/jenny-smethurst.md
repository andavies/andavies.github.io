Jenny, like many self-employed people, needed a simple website to advertise her business.

I made the website, as well as taking care of the domain name purchase (the website address) and hosting (a place for the site to live). I also helped Jenny put together a successful Facebook advertising campaign. I took care of the technical details so that Jenny could get on with running her business.

You can see the site [here](http://jennysmethurst.com). [Ed: this was made a few years back now. If I were making the same site today, it would be a [simple static site]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-15-on-jekyll-wordpress-and-speed %}).] 

If you're self-employed or a business owner who needs a quality website at a reasonable price, with no waffle or jargon, [contact me]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html) for a no-obligation chat.
